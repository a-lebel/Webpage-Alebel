The provider, responsible for the website, makes available to users this document with which it intends to comply with the obligations set forth in Law 34/2002, of Services of the Information Society and Electronic Commerce (LSSI-CE), as well as inform all users of the website regarding the conditions of use of the website.
Any person accessing this website assumes the role of user, committing to the observance and strict compliance with the provisions herein, as well as any other legal provision that may be applicable.
The provider reserves the right to modify any type of information that may appear on the website, without any obligation to give prior notice or inform users of such obligations, being understood as sufficient with the publication on the website of the provider.
 
<br><br>Responsability<br>
The provider disclaims any liability for the information published on its website, provided that this information has been manipulated or introduced by a third party unrelated to it.

The provider's website may use cookies (small information files that the server sends to the computer of the person accessing the page) to carry out certain functions that are considered essential for the proper functioning and display of the site. The cookies used on the website are, in any case, temporary and have the sole purpose of making subsequent transmission more efficient. They disappear at the end of the user’s session. Under no circumstances will cookies be used to collect personal information.

From the client's website, it is possible to redirect to content from third-party websites. Since the provider cannot always control the content introduced by third parties on their websites, it assumes no responsibility for such content. In any case, the provider states that it will immediately remove any content that may contravene national or international legislation, morality, or public order, proceeding to remove the redirection to that website immediately, and informing the competent authorities of the content in question.

The provider is not responsible for the information and content stored, including but not limited to, in forums, chats, blog generators, comments, social networks, or any other means that allow third parties to publish content independently on the provider's website. However, in compliance with the provisions of Articles 11 and 16 of the LSSI-CE, the provider makes itself available to all users, authorities, and security forces, actively collaborating in the removal or, if necessary, blocking of all content that may affect or contravene national or international legislation, third-party rights, or morality and public order. In the event that a user considers that there is any content on the website that could be subject to this classification, they are requested to notify the website administrator immediately.

This website has been reviewed and tested to ensure it functions correctly. In principle, correct functioning can be guaranteed 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. However, the provider does not rule out the possibility of certain programming errors, or events of force majeure, natural disasters, strikes, or similar circumstances that make it impossible to access the website.
<br><br>Intellectual and industrial property<br>

Here is the translation of the provided text:

The website, including but not limited to its programming, editing, compilation, and other elements necessary for its operation, as well as its designs, logos, text, and/or graphics, are the property of the provider or, if applicable, the provider has a license or express authorization from the authors. All content on the website is duly protected by intellectual and industrial property laws and is registered with the appropriate public registers.

Regardless of the purpose for which they were intended, the total or partial reproduction, use, exploitation, distribution, and commercialization require prior written authorization from the provider. Any use not previously authorized by the provider will be considered a serious violation of the intellectual or industrial property rights of the author.

Designs, logos, text, and/or graphics that belong to third parties and may appear on the website are the property of their respective owners, who are responsible for any possible disputes that may arise regarding them. In any case, the provider has obtained prior and express authorization from them.

The provider does NOT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE third parties to directly link to specific content on the website; they must always redirect to the main website of the provider.

The provider acknowledges the corresponding industrial and intellectual property rights in favor of their holders, and the mere mention or appearance on the website does not imply any rights or responsibilities of the provider regarding them, nor does it imply endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation by the provider.

In order to use the services, minors must always obtain prior consent from their parents, guardians or legal representatives, who are ultimately responsible for all acts performed by minors in their care. The responsibility for determining the specific content accessed by minors lies with them, which is why if they access inappropriate content on the Internet, mechanisms must be established on their computers, in particular computer programs, filters and blocks, which make it possible to limit the content available and, although not infallible, are particularly useful for controlling and restricting the material that minors can access.

In particular, and by way of example but not limitation, the User agrees not to transmit, disseminate, or make available to third parties information, data, content, messages, graphics, drawings, sound or image files, photographs, recordings, software, and, in general, any kind of material that:
